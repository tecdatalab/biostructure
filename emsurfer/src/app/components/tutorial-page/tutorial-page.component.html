  <strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Introduction The steady increase in the number of electron microscopy maps
  deposited in the
  <a class="text-warning" href="http://www.emdatabank.org"><u>EMDataBank</u></a>
  requires the development of search tools that can compare the isosurface of
  maps to help understand the relationships between them. EM-SURFER provides a
  web-based infrastructure to rapidly compare 3D EM maps based on isosurfaces
  derived from author-recommended contour levels. The features provided to users
  are discussed in detail below.
</p>
<p id="webInterface" align="left">
  <strong>Integrative Web Interface</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  EM-Surfer provides an easy-to-use search interface where a target EM map's
  isosurface shape is compared against the EMDataBank, using 3D Zernike
  Descriptors as an efficient shape descriptor. The query provided by the user
  can be compared against several surface representations. It can take into
  account volume differences between the target and maps in the database.
  Results can be easily visualized in a user-friendly search results page. By
  clicking one of the maps retrieved, a subsequent search is invoked using the
  map clicked as a query to further navigate 3D EM maps.
</p>
<p id="zernike" align="left">
  <strong>3D Zernike Descriptors</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  3D Zernike Descriptors (3DZD) are utilized for the efficient comparison of EM
  map isosurfaces. The descriptor is a combination of coefficients calculated
  from a set of orthogonal 3D basis polynomials that approximate a given 3D
  function (e.g. a grid representing the EM map). 3DZD has various desirable
  properties when applied to EM maps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li align="justify">
    <strong>Rotational invariance:</strong>&nbsp;Prior structural alignment is
    not required for map comparisons.
  </li>
  <li align="justify">
    <strong>Compactness:</strong> An individual surface can be compactly
    represented as a feature vector with only 121 numbers (called
    invariants).&nbsp; Comparisons of these vectors can be performed by
    calculating the Euclidean distance in a speedy fashion, thus enabling rapid
    shape retrieval. Furthermore, the concatenation of vectors that describe the
    same map at different contour levels create richer descriptors (up to 242
    and 363 numbers in <em>EM-SURFER</em>).
  </li>
  <li align="justify">
    <strong>Hierarchical Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Invariants of lower
    resolution are also part of the higher resolution. For example, the first 12
    numbers among the 121 invariants represent a coarse-grained version of the
    surface, while the complete 121 invariants provide the best approximation of
    the surface that the polynomials can give us.
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
  For more technical details about the use of the 3DZD for EM map comparison,
  please refer to our previous work

  <strong>3DZD Computation Procedure</strong>
</p>
<img src="assets/img/EM3DZDProcess.png" />
<ol>
  <li align="justify">
    <strong>Isosurface generation:</strong> Three isosurfaces at different
    density levels are created for each EM map in the database. One comes from
    the author-recommended contour, as specified in the EMDataBank.
    Additionally, two higher isovalues are used to represent regions that are
    closer to the core of the molecules. In 1/3 Core Contour, an increased
    contour level, 1/3 * (max density - recommended contour) is used. The same
    idea applies for 2/3 Core Contour, just changing the factor from 1/3 to 2/3.
  </li>
  <li align="justify">
    <strong>3D Zernike transformation:</strong> The 3DZD program
    <a class="text-warning" href="tutorial#reference" target="_blank"
      ><u>[Novotni M. and Klein R, 2003]</u></a
    >
    takes the cubic grid as input and generates 3DZDs for each surface
    representation (121 invariants).
  </li>
  <li align="justify">
    <strong>Zernike invariant combinations:</strong>
    The previous step creates three vectors of size 121. The various shape
    representation alternatives offered by EM-SURFER arise from a combination of
    these. For example,
    <em>EMDB contour+1/3+2/3</em> uses a descriptor vector of size 363, by
    concatenating all three vectors. On the other hand,
    <em>EMDB contour</em> uses only the 121 invariants from the
    author-recommended contour value.
  </li>

  <strong>Search Results by EM-SURFER</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  A search against the whole EMDB entries can be performed from the
  <a class="text-warning" routerLink="../search"><u>search page</u></a>
  .
</p>
<ul>
  <li align="justify">
    In Step 1, choose the contour shape representation. The default is set to
    the author-recommended contour level, but users can choose any of the other
    3 options.
  </li>

  <li align="justify">
    In Step 2, choose the EMDB entry ID or upload an EM map file. To find an ID
    by a text search using for example, protein name, use the
    <a class="text-warning" routerLink="../search"><u> EMDB search page</u></a
    >.<br />
    <a id="upload_troubleshooting"></a>
    <em>Upload troubleshooting:</em> While EM-SURFER has several checks and
    repair machanisms to process uploaded files, it is possible that some errors
    arise. These situations occur because of network connectivity problems while
    uploading files, incorrect formatting in the EM file uploaded, etc. If you
    experience a problem uploading your map please contact
    <a class="text-warning" href="mailto:dkihara@purdue.edu" target="_blank"
      ><u> dkihara@purdue.edu</u></a
    >
  </li>

  <li align="justify">
    In Step 3, a volume filter is provided. The default is on. When this filter
    is on, a search only retrieves EM maps that have similar volume to the
    query.
  </li>

  The figure below explains the search result page:

        The dissimilarity of two EM isosurfaces are quantified by the Euclidean
        distance (the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences

    <strong>Ratio of the volume of the retrieved entry to the query</strong>

  <strong>Job Submission and 3DZD Computation in Batch Mode </strong>
</p>
<p>
  When users would like to benchmark EM-SURFER by submitting a large number of
  queries, they can use the
  <a class="text-warning" routerLink="../benchmark"><u> batch mode page</u></a
  >.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When submitting a batch of queries to EM-SURFER, users can either type a
    custom list of EMDB IDs or upload a separate file with those IDs.

    Taking the same steps as the submission of a single entry, users can go
    through the page to select an isosurface representation, and specify the
    volume filter.

  <li>
    The extra step in this section is to select the number/size of the retrieved
    list for each query.
