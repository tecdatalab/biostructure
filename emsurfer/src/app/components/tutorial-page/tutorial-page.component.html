          web-based infrastructure to rapidly compare 3D EM maps based on isosurfaces

          EM-Surfer provides an easy-to-use search interface where a target EM map's
          isosurface shape is compared against the EMDataBank, using 3D Zernike
          Descriptors as an efficient shape descriptor. The query provided by the user
          can be compared against several surface representations. It can take into
          account volume differences between the target and maps in the database.
          Results can be easily visualized in a user-friendly search results page. By
          clicking one of the maps retrieved, a subsequent search is invoked using the
          map clicked as a query to further navigate 3D EM maps.

          3D Zernike Descriptors (3DZD) are utilized for the efficient comparison of EM
          map isosurfaces. The descriptor is a combination of coefficients calculated
          from a set of orthogonal 3D basis polynomials that approximate a given 3D
          function (e.g. a grid representing the EM map). 3DZD has various desirable
          properties when applied to EM maps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li align="justify">
            <strong>Rotational invariance:</strong>&nbsp;Prior structural alignment is
            not required for map comparisons.
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            <strong>Compactness:</strong> An individual surface can be compactly
            represented as a feature vector with only 121 numbers (called
            invariants).&nbsp; Comparisons of these vectors can be performed by
            calculating the Euclidean distance in a speedy fashion, thus enabling rapid
            shape retrieval. Furthermore, the concatenation of vectors that describe the
            same map at different contour levels create richer descriptors (up to 242
            and 363 numbers in <em>EM-SURFER</em>).
          </li>
          <li align="justify">
            <strong>Hierarchical Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;Invariants of lower
            resolution are also part of the higher resolution. For example, the first 12
            numbers among the 121 invariants represent a coarse-grained version of the
            surface, while the complete 121 invariants provide the best approximation of
            the surface that the polynomials can give us.

            <strong>Isosurface generation:</strong> Three isosurfaces at different
            density levels are created for each EM map in the database. One comes from
            the author-recommended contour, as specified in the EMDataBank.
            Additionally, two higher isovalues are used to represent regions that are
            closer to the core of the molecules. In 1/3 Core Contour, an increased
            contour level, 1/3 * (max density - recommended contour) is used. The same
            idea applies for 2/3 Core Contour, just changing the factor from 1/3 to 2/3.

            representation alternatives offered by EM-SURFER arise from a combination of
            these. For example,
            <em>EMDB contour+1/3+2/3</em> uses a descriptor vector of size 363, by
            concatenating all three vectors. On the other hand,
            <em>EMDB contour</em> uses only the 121 invariants from the
            author-recommended contour value.
