          A web-based tool for real-time comparison and analysis of Electron
          Microscopy (EM) density maps.</strong
        >
        It compares the shape of EM map isosurfaces, generated using
        author-recommended contour values. Users can either upload an EM map or
        choose an existing map in the
        <a class="text-warning" href="http://www.emdatabank.org" target="_blank"
          ><u>EMDataBank</u></a
        >
        and compare it against maps stored in the EMDataBank. 3D-Zernike
        Descriptors (3DZD) are utilized for the efficient comparison between EM
        maps. The web interface will conveniently display a quantitative measure
        of similarty between the isosurface shape of EM maps, as well as a
        measure indicating how similar the target isosurface is to the maps
        retrieved in the search. <em>EM-SURFER</em> provides the users with the
        option of comparing EM maps using additional contour levels, based on
        the original values recommended by each map's authors. It also provides
        filtering features to compare the target only to maps with a similar
        volume.

        <strong>Surface representation:</strong> Four isosurface representation
        options are provided. The first one is the isosurface generated at the
        author-recommended contour level found in the EMDB. Three additional
        options combine the author-recommended contour level with the isosurface
        created by increasing the contour value to represent regions of a higher
        density, which is usually closer to the core of the molecules.
